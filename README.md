# hybrid_motor_design_sim
This repository contains all relevant software for Hybrid Rocket Motor sizing. This includes a low fidelity trajectory simulation that allows for motor sizing by desired apogee altitude. The general architecture of this simulation tool is outlined in the confluence page accessible at this url https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/qgtPHQ
